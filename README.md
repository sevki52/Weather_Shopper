mvn compile: it will just compile the code of your application and tell you if there are errors

mvn test: it will compile the code of your application and your tests. 
It will then run your tests and let you know if some fails

mvn install: it will do everything mvn test does and then if everything looks 
file it will install the library or the application into your local maven repository
